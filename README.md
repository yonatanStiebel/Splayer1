**Splayer1** is a split, wireless, ortholinear, column-staggered, splayed keyboard. 

Each half of the keyboard has 3 rows, 5 columns and 3 extra thumb keys. 

The pinky and ring finger columns are slightly staggered and splayed (hence the name), making for a non-aggressive layout.

The PCB is flippable, and can be used for both halves of the keyboard.
